# Retail_Sales_Predictions
# Problem Statement
Hoffman operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 countries. Hoffman store managers are currently tasked with predicting their daily sales up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school, and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied.
You are provided with historical sales data for 1,115 Hoffman stores. The task is to forecast the "Sales" column for the test set. Note that some stores in the dataset were temporarily closed for refurbishment.
# Project Goal
Our goal here is to forecast the sales for six weeks for each store and find out the factors influencing it and recommend ways in order to improve the numbers.
